Hi,

I have used randomforest regressor due to its high acuuracy.
I have even used Artificial Neural net for the same.
All the null values were imputed.
Some values were corrected through out the data.
EDA analysis were performed in the data set.
I have also done feature engineering to find out more features in the current dataset.
